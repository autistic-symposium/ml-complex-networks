MNet 4.0 - Complex Network Analysis Package
===========================================

Extraction and analysis of several graph features from publicly available datasets using NetworkX.

Analyzed Features:
------------------

1* Assortativity
2* Clique number
3* Clustering
4* Density
5* Diameter
6* Edge connectivity
7* Node connectivity
8* Number of cliques
9* Number of edges
10* Number of nodes
11* Radius
12* Clustering and Transitivity
13* Betweeness centrality
14* Closeness centrality
15* Communicability centrality
16* Coreness
17* Degree centrality
18* Eccentricity
19* Number of triangles
20* Pagerank
21* Square clustering
22* Transitivity





Networks:
---------
1* Social networks: online social networks, edges represent interactions between people
2* Ground truth: ground-truth network communities in social and information networks 
3* Communication: email communication networks with edges representing communication
4* Citation: nodes represent papers, edges represent citations
5* Collaboration: nodes represent scientists, edges represent collaborations (co-authoring a paper)
6* Web graphs: nodes represent webpages and edges are hyperlinks
7* Products: nodes represent products and edges link commonly co-purchased products
8* p2p: nodes represent computers and edges communication
9* Roads: nodes represent intersections and edges roads connecting the intersections
10* Autonomous systems: graphs of the internet
11* Signed networks: networks with positive and negative edges (friend/foe, trust/distrust)
12* Location based networks: Social networks with geographic check-ins
13* Wikipedia: Talk, editing and voting data from Wikipedia
14* Bio Atlas: Food-webs  selected from Ecosystem Network Analysis site and from ATLSS.                 
15* Bio Cellular: Substrate in cellular network of corresponding organism.     
16* Bio Metabolic: Metabolic network of corresponding organism.      
17* Bio Carbon: Carbon exchanges in the cypress wetlands of South Florida during the wet and dry season. 
18* Bio Yeast: Protein-protein interaction network in budding yeast.  



Normalization and Graph sampling:
---------------------------------
Performed using snowball sampling (choosing the sample order, i.e. number of nodes). Optimized for number of edges and multiple samplings.
